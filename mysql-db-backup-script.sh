# DBHOSTNAME is the host name of the host that hosts yours MySQL database.
# You can get this from GoDaddy. Just replace the entire contents after =
# with your database host name.
# DBHOSTNAME=xxxxx.db.xxxxxxx.hostedresource.com

# DBUSERNAME is the username to access the MySQL database. Just replace
# the word databaseusername below with your username. No
# quotes needed.
DBUSERNAME='root'

# DBPASSWORD is the password to access the MySQL database. Just replace
# the word databasepassword below with your password database. No
# quotes needed.

# DBNAME is the MySQL database that needs to be backed up. Typically, in
# GoDaddy Linux Hosting this is  the same as the DBUSERNAME

# Path of the folder where backups will be stored. $HOME/html will
# automatically put you in the hosting accounts root folder. GoDaddy MySQL
# databases are normally stored in the _db_backups folder within your base
# hosting folder. If the folder does not exist create it before running the
# script. You can also create a subfolder within _db_backups folder if you
# would like to backup the database to a separate folder. Alternatively,
# you can backup to an entirely different folder of your choice. Whatever
# you choose to do, ensure that the path is correctly specified below.

# Should the script delete older files based on the conditions you set
# below (Y or N - uppercase letters only). Choosing Y will maintain only
# recent backups based on your settings below. Choosing N will keep all
# the backups from the past.

# Number of recent daily backups to keep. The default is 6 (Sun-Fri) with
# Weekly backup on Sat.All previous backups will be deleted. This is
# meaningless unless DAILYBACKUP is set to Y.

# are done on Saturdays.

# Do monthly backups Y or N? (one uppercase letter only). Monthly backups
# are done on the last day of the month.

# Number of recent monthly backups to keep. The default is 2. All previous
